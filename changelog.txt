## v7.0.0 (Next-Gen) — 2025-09-24
- Unified God Mode: All optimizations run in one safe, reversible flow.
- Safety Layer: System Restore Point creation, targeted registry exports, and Dry-Run mode.
- Rollback Hooks: Capture original power plan, registry keys, and restore them on rollback.
- Ultimate Performance: Auto-import + enable if missing, with rollback to user’s original plan.
- ADB Verification: Setprop with verification, plus pre/post gfxinfo FPS dump.
- Centralized Logging: Detailed ChangeLog object + run report in `NEXUS-Backups`.
- Modern Windows Tweaks: Game Mode, GPU scheduling, performance visual effects.
- Legacy tweaks (bcdedit, netsh autotuning, thermal disable) still included but tagged as risky.
